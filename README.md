# Data Mining Final Project
Dataset: MyAnimeList Dataset<br>
Team: Warren Wang<br>
Objective: Be able to generate new anime recommendations given a person's watched anime list.

## Data
Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/azathoth42/myanimelist?resource=download](Kaggle Download)
The dataset we are using is taken from a popular and widely used online community discussion platform for anime fans called [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/).
In the kaggle repo where we found this dataset, it looks like the uploader also has helped clean up some of the data for us, but also included the raw data if we want to explore that as well. 
The timestamp for this kaggle data is that it was uploaded 6 years ago, in 2018. 

## Environment Reproduction using Anaconda/Pip:
```
conda create -n csci349final python=3.10.13
conda activate csci349final
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
